#+STARTUP: overview
#+OPTIONS: toc:2
 
This file includes notes and summary of the course [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science][SQL for Data
Science]] from University of California, Davis available in Coursera
as well as additional information that I find useful to learn but it's
missing in the course. You can use it as a supplementary material if
you're taking the course or as an standalone summary of basics of SQL
for data science.

You are encouraged to download the README.org and open it inside Emacs
if you're familiar with org mode. It has the same content.

* WEEK #2
Filtering sorting and calculating data with SQL
** Introduction
*** Clauses and operators
- WHERE
- BETWEEN AND
- IN
- OR
- NOT
- LIKE
- ORDER BY
- GROUP BY
*** Wildcards
*** Math operators
- AVERAGE
- COUNT
- MAX
- MIN
** Basics of Filtering with SQL
*** where clause operator
#+begin_src sql
  SELECT col1, col2 FROM my_table
	 WHERE col operator value;
#+end_src
operator can be
- =
- <> (not equal !=)
- <
- >
- >=
- <=
- BETWEEN AND
- IS NULL
*** BETWEEN AND
#+begin_src sql
  select city from customers where customerid between 4 and 10;	
#+end_src
** Advanced Filtering: IN, OR, and NOT
*** IN
- use parentheses for more than one condition with comma between them
  #+begin_src sql
    select country from customers where city in ('Paris', 'Rome', 'Oslo');		
  #+end_src
*** OR
| WHERE | X     | or | Y     | output |
|-------+-------+----+-------+--------|
|       | true  | or | false | X      |
|       | true  | or | true  | X      |
|       | false | or | false | nil    |
|       | false | or | true  | Y      |
*** IN or OR
- IN is faster
- OR: order is important
- IN: order is not important
- IN: making sub-queries
*** OR  AND
| WHERE | X | OR | Y | AND | Z | output |
|-------+---+----+---+-----+---+--------|
|       | T |    | F |     | F | X      |
OR is executed before AND. By using parentheses we can force to check
AND condition:
| WHERE | (X | OR | Y) | AND | Z | output |
|-------+----+----+----+-----+---+--------|
|       | T  |    | F  |     | F | nil    |
** Using Wildcards in SQL
*** LIKE operator(predicate)
Used for only string data not numerical data. 
- %: '%string', 'st%g', 'st%'
  it does not match NULL value
- _: is not supported in DB2 but most other system support it.
  #+begin_src sql
	    WHERE val LIKE '_string'
  #+end_src
- []: not supported in SQLite
- Wildcards are slower than filtering operators 
** ORDER BY
- It should be the last clause in an statement
- Different columns can be used for sorting
- Column position can be used
  #+begin_src sql
    ORDER BY 1,5
  #+end_src
- DESC: descending
- ASC: ascending
- DESC and ASC should be repeated for each column
** Math Operations
Creating new column in the output from math operations on other
columns:
#+begin_src sql
  SELECT col1,col2, col1*col2 AS new_col
	 FROM my_table;
#+end_src
new_col is as alias for the new column 
** Aggregate Functions
- AVG()
- COUNT()
- MIN()
- MAX()
- SUM()
#+begin_src sql
  SELECT AVG(col1) AS col1_avg FROM my_table;
	 -- null rows are ignored 
#+end_src
#+begin_src sql
  SELECT count(*) AS total_rows FROM my_table;
	 -- it counts null rows
	 -- if you count a specific column, it ignores null rows
#+end_src
AS is not mandatory.

*** DISTINCT
It recognizes duplicates in a column
#+begin_src sql
  SELECT count(DISTINCT col1)
	 FROM my_table
#+end_src
** Grouping Data with SQL
*** GROUP BY
  In the following example we are counting the number of cities each
  country has in our table customers:
  #+begin_src sql
    select country, count(city) from customers group by country ;	
  #+end_src
*** HAVING
  It filters the result of group by like where. In the following
  example, the result is filtered to those countries with customers
  having a special email patter: 
  #+begin_src sql
    select country, count(city) from customers group by country having  email like '%com';	
  #+end_src
  We can use multiple columns for group by. If there are more columns
  in the group by, these groups need to be in the select part
  too. NULL is categorized separately.

  WHERE is used before grouping and HAVING is used after it. 
* Sample Database
Download the sample database called chinook from this [[https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/][link]].
** see columns in a sample table
#+begin_src sql
	  select * from genres; 
#+end_src
* GENERAL COMMANDS
- open the database
  #+begin_src sql
	  .open chinook.db
#+end_src

  #+begin_src sql
	  .tables
#+end_src
- .help: show help for dot commands
- .database: show the connected databases in the session
- attach a database
  #+begin_src sql
	    attach database "address.db" as db_name;
  #+end_src
- .exit: exit the sqlite
- showing the structure of a table

  #+end_src
- .indexes: show the indexes of the current database or table
- write query result into a file
  #+begin_src sql
    .output filename
